Project notes
-In this project you do not need to create multiple branches. You may make changes to the main branch and push changes from your local main branch to the remote main branch. Using multiple branches is optional.
-You will be revisiting your GitHub profile page and making updates after this week. On the one hand, make your profile page presentable. On the other hand, don't spend too much time on the markdown file.
-The most challenging part of this project may be including an image. You may experiment or ask others for help in including an image.
