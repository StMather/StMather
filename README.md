# Welcome
## On GitHub I am...
...participating in a *Microsoft Leap Internal Program* and brushing up on 5+ years of missed codeing. So far GitHub is how I remember it but HTML and Markdown are new to me. Excited for C# and where this all will lead. React Js was a unxpected challange but one I am up for!

## I Enjoy:
- Being a part of solutions
- Finding creative resolutions to problems
- Taking time to think before I put in my 2 cents
- Spending time with my family, riding motorcycles, working on classic cars, hiking, target shooting, video games and driving my wife **slowly** over the edge.

-You will be revisiting your GitHub profile page and making updates after this week. On the one hand, make your profile page presentable. On the other hand, don't spend too much time on the markdown file.
-The most challenging part of this project may be including an image. You may experiment or ask others for help in including an image.
